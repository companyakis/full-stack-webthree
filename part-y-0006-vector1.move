Now it's your turn, let's add more daily_visitors to your Island....So we need to add daily_visitors variable of type vector<u64> to the Move my_shore module.

/*
What is a Vector?

Think of a vector like a list that can hold items in a specific order of specific type.

Creating Vectors: We can create variety of vectors for example:

An empty vector: vector[] or vector<T>[], where T is any non-reference type.

A vector with elements: vector[e1, ..., en] or vector<T>[e1, ..., en], where n is the number of elements.

Special Case: Byte Arrays with vector<u8>:

Vectors of bytes are common, often used for things like public keys or hash results. We are particularly talking about two different categories Byte Strings and Hex Strings.

Byte strings: Quoted string literals with a b prefix, like b"Hello!\n".

Hex strings: Quoted string literals with an x prefix, like x"48656C6C6F210A". Each pair of characters represents a byte in hexadecimal form.

Wondering what \n in the previous example is?

These are nothing but escape sequences that are used along with these byte/hex strings for representation purposes.

A few other example of escape Sequences in Byte Strings are -

\n: New line
\r: Carriage return
\t: Tab
\xHH: Hex escape, where HH represents a hexadecimal byte, etc.
