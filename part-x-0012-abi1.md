ABI (Application Binary Interface) is an important part of interacting with smart contracts. It defines the functions that a contract exposes and how different applications can interact with them.

Once compiled, we can see the compilation details, including the ABI. The ABI is a JSON-formatted document that specifies the contract's functions, inputs, outputs, and other metadata.

The ABI is used by applications to interact with the smart contract. By providing the ABI to a library or tool, the application can understand the contract's functions and interact with them accordingly.

The ABI doesn't include the contract's logic. It only defines the interface for interacting with the contract.
