/*

Move uses a module-based structure, enabling developers to publish code in the form of modules containing both executables and data structure declarations. 
This method promotes code reuse and more efficient organization, facilitating the development of complex blockchain projects.
Each Move module is published under a specific account address on the Aptos blockchain. 
The account address can be stored in an alias, so you don't have to rewrite it every time.
